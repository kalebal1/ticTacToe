This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made with guidance from a Hyperskill project.
The user can play against the computer, against another user, or pitch two computer players against each other.

The field is set up as a 2-dimensional array with the coordinates as follows:
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

To start, enter "start" into the console, then assign the players by entering either "user" or "easy."
