This is a simple tic-tac-toe game made with guidance from a Hyperskill project.
The user can play against the computer, against another user, or pitch two computer players against each other.

The field is set up as a 2-dimensional array with the coordinates as follows:
(1, 3) (2, 3) (3, 3)
(1, 2) (2, 2) (3, 2)
(1, 1) (2, 1) (3, 1)

To start, enter "start" into the console, then assign the players by entering either "user" or "easy/medium/hard"
When prompted, enter the coordinates where you'd like to place your marker separated by a space. 
After you make your move, the computer will make theirs and then the updated board will print out!

Note: Currently all the difficulties route to easy mode (i.e. you should be able to beat the computer with ease) -- I'm working on hard mode using a minimax algorithm that may or may not be unbeatable. We'll see. Right now it's beating me.
